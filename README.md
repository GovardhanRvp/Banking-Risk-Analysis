# Banking-Risk-Analysis
## Problem Statement-
Delop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers
## Solution-
With our dashboards which are created using Power Bi latest tools helps the company to make a decision based on the applicant's profile like if the applicant is likely to repay the loan then approving the loan otherwise not.
## About Dataset-
This dataset basically contains information about bank details, various client details.

## Process
1.Data Collection – Gathered client banking data including demographics, deposits, loans, income, and account information.
2.Data Cleaning & Preparation – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized numerical and categorical fields for consistency.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzed distributions, outliers, and relationships between financial indicators such as deposits, savings, and loans.
4.Correlation Analysis – Identified patterns among key variables (e.g., deposits–savings link, age–income influence, business vs. personal lending behavior).
5.Risk Classification – Evaluated customer profiles to detect potential risk segments based on income, liabilities, and product usage.
6.Insights & Visualization – Created visual dashboards (Power BI / Tableau) to present findings on customer engagement, financial stability, and risk exposure.
7.Conclusion & Recommendations – Summarized key risk drivers and provided actionable insights for improved risk management and customer segmentation.

## Insights
## Deposits and Savings Behavior
The high correlation between Bank Deposits and Saving Accounts suggests that these may either measure overlapping financial behavior (e.g., total funds a customer keeps in the bank) or that people who actively deposit funds also tend to maintain or grow savings balances
## Income, Age and Accumulation
Moderate correlations of Age and Estimated Income with various balances (Superannuation, Savings, Checking) reflect a common financial lifecycle trend: higher income earners and older individuals often accumulate more savings, retirement funds, and may carry higher credit card balances or loans.
## Low Correlation with Properties Owned
Property ownership may depend on external factors (location, real estate market conditions, inheritance, etc.) that are not captured by these particular banking variables. Hence, we see weaker correlations here.
## Business vs. Personal Banking
Business Lending’s moderate link to Bank Loans suggests some customers may have both personal and business debts. However, business lending is relatively uncorrelated with other deposit or property-related metrics, indicating it may serve a distinct subset of customers or needs.

## Conclusion
The banking risk analysis identified key factors influencing customer and portfolio risk.
Strong links between deposits and savings indicate stable, low-risk customer behavior, while higher income and age correlate with stronger financial positions.
Weak correlation with property ownership and distinct patterns in business lending highlight areas of potential exposure.
Overall, the analysis helps assess financial stability, classify customer risk levels, and support data-driven risk management decisions
